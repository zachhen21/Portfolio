        <h2>Welcome to the Black Forest!</h2>
        <p>Once the first boss is defeated the player is provided with the task to find copper and tin. These resources are found only within the Black Forest, and in order to progress through the game they are essential.
        This biome can be dangerous at first, but with a bow and early armor equipped it's just a matter of watching your surroundings. There is a lot to do within this biome, but first start looking for locations called burial chambers.
        These are typically guarded by skeletons, and these dungeons hold the needed ingredients for a lot of needed crafting stations. Burial Chambers are filled with skeletons and ghosts, but if you tread carefully, they can be taken down easily. 
        You are looking for red cubes called Surtling Cores, and if it's your first time exploring the biome you will need at least 10 of these cores. Besides the skeletons the black forest is also home to creatures that are very similar to the meadows. 
        Deer will also call this biome home, and they will indeed act the same as they do in the meadows. The other set of beasts in this biome are related to the greylings. This family of creatures are tree-like beasts, and they have a variety of attacks.
        First off there are the Greydwarves. These are the easiest of the tree creatures found in this biome. They act a lot like the greylings, but in general they just hit a little bit harder. 
        Next up there is the Greydwarf Shaman, and these are somewhat dangerous. Shamans let off a green particle attack that both heals like creatures and poisons the player. If you are not prepared the poison can be quite deadly.
        The last of the Greydwarf line of beasts is the Brute. Greydwarf Brutes are very dangerous when exploring the black forest early on. They are very tanky mobs, and often it is just better to run. All the tree-like beasts are afraid of fire as well!
        The last creature within the black forest is the Troll. They are very large mobs who hit like a truck. Trolls can often be heard before you see them as their feet stomp the ground quite hard. 
        Trolls are easily killed with a bow, but you need to keep your distance. If you attack them from up close there is a good chance you will die. Trolls can also be found in Troll Caves within the biome as well.
        These caves are easy to see as they stick out against the landscape quite well. When exploring the black forest, it's important to look out for a variety of goodies that scatter the ground.
        You will find carrot seeds, blueberries, thistle, and mushrooms here. These are all ingredients that are worth stocking up on as they are commonly found in food recipes. After a exploring for a while you will more than likely find copper nodes.
        These stand out from regular stone nodes as they have a little sheen to them. These are large nodes of ore, and it's very worthwhile to mark these on your minimap. The other ore found within the forest is tin.
        This is found along the shorelines of the black forest, and they are easy to find. Both copper and tin will show their names if you point your cursor on them as well. Once you have mined a fair bit of each resource it's time to cook them up.
        The surtling cores found earlier will be crafted into smelting stations, and with these you can cook the metals found in the black forest. Each metal has uses of their own, but copper and tin can also be combined into bronze.
        Making bronze tools and armor is a defining moment within the black forest stage of the game. This unlocks a variety of tools for the player, and this includes boats! A bronze axe can also allow for collection of all tree types, and this in turn provides the player with a variety of new wood types.

        <h2>Boss 2: The Elder</h2>
        <p>The second boss you will encounter in Valheim is the Elder. This boss shares a striking image to that of the Greydwarf creatures, and it will also share their weaknesses. This boss is very weak to fire and can be taken down easily with fire arrows.
        It attacks the player with large vine-like tentacles, and if these hit you, they can be quite dangerous. The Elder's spawn altar has four large pillars on each corner, and these can be used to hide from its attacks.
        In order to spawn this beast, you will need ancient seeds that are dropped from greydwarf spawners within the forest. These spawners can be seen with a dense purple aura around them, and once destroyed they drop an ancient seed.
        If you manage to defeat the Elder, you will be rewared with its head and a swamp key. The head will grant the player with a buff that makes trees easier to cut once returned to its stone. The key that you recieve will be used in the Swamp to enter the biome dungeons.
