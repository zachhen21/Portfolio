        <h2>Welcome to the Swamp!</h2>
        <p>For those who are not prepared the swamp biome can be a beast. For first timers it is recommended that you create poison-resistance mead, and this is done at a brewing station. Armor is also needed more so than the previous biomes as the mobs here are rough.
        If you do not have a swamp connected to your starting island you will need to craft a karve. This boat will allow you to sail the seas in order to find this biome. There is also a raft within the game, and this is technically accessible before the karve.
        Although I would not recommend making a raft as they aren't really that friendly to sail. When sailing around swamps are very easy to spot based off their terrain. The trees in the biome look like larger dead trees, and their branches stretch out quite a bit.
        It's easy to get this biome confused with the Mistlands as they have very similar trees, but the Mistlands will have much larger trees. The terrain of the swamp biome consists of very patchy land, and there are often trees covered in a green guck substance.
        If you are indeed sailing here, it’s a good idea to park in a black forest or meadows biome that is near a swamp. If you land here its much easier to walk into the swamp instead of parking there.
        The waters within the swamp biome are home to large leaches, and these can really damage your boat if you are not paying attention. By this point you have access to portals, and if you park your boat in a neighboring biome you can also safely plop a portal down there.
        Skeletons call this biome home as well, but they will roam the biome instead of staying around the biome dungeon. One of the other enemies you will find here is called a draugr. These are essentially zombified Vikings, and they are very tanky.
        Your first time in the swamp is much easier if you try and stay away from groups of draugr and fight them in smaller numbers. The swamp is also full of large slime creatures. There is the larger Oozer and the regular slime.
        The slimes and the leeches will poison the player so it's best to fight these with caution. When roaming the swamp make sure to look out for turnip seeds as they are needed to grow turnips which are a great food source.
        Swamp dungeons are called Sunken Crypts, and these are seen with green torches in front of them. As the swamp is flat these tend to stick out very clearly. If you find a large swamp biome there will more than likely be a lot of these.
        With your swamp key in your inventory these crypts are traversable. Within the sunken crypts you will find the same creatures that fill the swamp biome, but it's a much tighter area so it's best to explore with caution.
        These dungeons are home to iron which is the next step up from bronze. Since you can't take metal through portals you will more than likely must sail this iron back to your home. Once smelted the iron tools and weapons are a fantastic upgrade.
        </p>

        <h2>Boss 3: Bonemass</h2>
        <p>The altar that is used to spawn Bonemass is in the shape of a giant skull. Like the sunken crypts this spawner is easy to see if you are near it. In order to spawn bonemass you will need necrotic bone, and this is found where you would find iron.
        This boss is another slime-like creature, but it's much larger than the other ones within this biome. It's important to carry poison resistance with you for this fight as both bonemass and its additional mobs will poison you.
        Bonemass is weak to blunt damage, so a bow is not a great weapon this time around. From my experience an iron mace is one of the best options for this fight. By this point you will already have iron, and the mace is just a good weapon in general.
        Once bonemass is down you will again receive a head and with it you also get a wishbone. The head will provide the player with a general physical resistance upgrade once returned to the stones, and the wishbone will be used to find silver within the mountain biome.
