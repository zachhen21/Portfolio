        <h2>Welcome to the Plains!</h2>
        <p>The plains are by far the hardest biome that is currently finished within the world of Valheim. Even experienced players should proceed with caution when exploring this biome.
        By this point in the game, you have more than likely encountered this biome at some point within your save game. Its notable features are large stone pillars, golden grass, and birch forests.
        It's home to a goblin race of mobs called Fulings. These are small mobs, but they are indeed a force to be reckoned with. Like the greydwarves these fulings come in a variety of forms.
        There are spear throwers, torchbearers, shamans, and brutes. These creatures both roam the plains and reside within large compounds. You must raid these compounds at some point in order to get needed items from this biome.
        Within the new update there is also now tar pits. These pits spawn large tar-slime creatures that shoot large blast of tar at the player. Their drops are pretty much strictly a cosmetic item as well.
        You may also see some large buffalo-like creatures called a Lox as well. These are naturally hostile animals, but they drop very good food and leather. The final mob is one that most people encounter by accident.
        Within the plains lives large mosquito creatures called deathsquitos. Most people will accidently aggro these when sailing, and at most points in the game these creatures would kill you in one hit.
        If you enter the plains with caution all mobs within the biome can be picked off, and it becomes easier with experience. This biome is not home to a specific dungeon as the fuling camps tend to fill that spot.
        When exploring you may also come across cloud berries, barley, and flax. These resources are used to create currently end game foods and gear. 
        </p>

        <h2>Boss 5: Yagluth</h2>
        <p>The final boss that is currently in Valheim is a giant broken-down skeleton king called Yagluth. Being the last boss of the game, it really isn't that hard to take down. By the point you would fight it your gear is practically end game type loot.
        Yagluth's altar is incredibly visible from the surrounding terrain as well. It essentially looks like stone fingers piercing out of the ground around an altar. You need to obtain fuling totems from their compounds in order to summon this boss as well.
        It currently drops an item that isn't fully finished within the game (Unfortunately). You will also receive its head like the other bosses, and the buff you receive from this boss is a general resistance to fire, frost, and lightning.
