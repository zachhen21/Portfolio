        <h2>Welcome to the Mountains!</h2>
        <p>Like the swamp biome, the mountains are quite the challenge your first time around. This biome is extremely cold, and those who are not prepared will freeze to death. You will need a frost-resistance mead your first time around to explore this biome. Mountains can be found on almost any island, but it's important to find a tall mountain biome. In order to find Silver, which is the biome resource, you will need a very tall mountain. Along with silver you will also find obsidian deposits. As you need a wishbone to find silver it's easier to initially look for obsidian to make sure your mountain is tall enough. Within this biome you will find a lot of new enemies, and they are all quite tough. First off there are wolves and fenrings. Wolves are basic, but they are fast and strong. If you do not have good equipment these will take you out easily. Fenrings are large werewolf like creatures that spawn at night. They are a similar difficulty to that of the regular wolves, but they are just a tad bit faster. Flying around the mountains you will also find drakes. These will shoot large frost projectiles at the player, and if you get caught in its crossfire things can get bad fast. You will often see drakes firing at other mobs in the biome, and they can sometimes be used to take out other enemies. The largest of the mobs within the mountains in the stone golem. These are incredibly tanky mobs, and they are even much tougher than the trolls of the black forest. If you can't take one out, they can be kited around and used to mine the area of its resources. Their hits tend to break rocks around you, and if you use them right you can get stone very easily. When walking around the swamp with your wishbone on you may notice that the wishbone will start pinging from time to time. This means that you have come close to a silver node! These are often buried in the ground, but once acquired silver can be used to create amazing tools. It's worth farming the mobs in this area for resources as they all drop needed goodies. The mountains also contain onions which are another food type that is worth finding.

        <h2>Boss 4: Moder</h2>
        <p>On the top of the highest mountains is where you will find the moder altar. In order to summon this beast, you will need to seek out three dragon eggs, and these are found within the mountain biome.
        Moder is quite different from the other bosses as it doesn't primarily fight on the ground. The boss is a larger form of the drakes found within the biome, and its attacks are quite similar as well. 
        Occasionally it will land on the ground, and that is one of the best points to really lay out damage. Overall, this boss isn't incredibly hard, but it all comes down to having up-to-date gear.
        If you come to the fight in silver armor and gear you will be appropriately fitted for the fight. Once you manage to kill moder you will be granted with a wind speed sailing buff, and you also get moder tears.
        As odd as getting the bosses tears is they are very useful. These tears are used to craft a multitude of crafting stations, and they are needed to process items from the Plains biome.
