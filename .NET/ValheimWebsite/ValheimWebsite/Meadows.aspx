        <h2>Welcome to the Meadows!</h2>
        <p>The Meadows is the calmest biome within the game. This is the biome that every player is introduced to upon arriving at the realm of Valheim.
        It's home to a variety of beasts, and while some of them may attack on site they are not very strong. Meadows are often a fantastic place to set up your initial base.
        There is an ample amount of all resources needed to construct your initial encampment. Building within the meadows is practically essential early on. Other biomes may be noticeable nearby, but they should be avoided until you are properly equipped.
        When looking to build a home in this biome you will need to acquire quite a lot of wood. There are going to be a variety of trees within this biome, and these include Beech, Birch, and Oak trees. 
        Early on you will only be able to chop beech trees, but the others will be accessible within time. On the shores of this biome, you will also find flint scattering the ground, and it's important to at least remember where the flint is located.
        Stone is another resource to look around for. It's very similar to that of flint, but it will be scattered throughout the entire biome. There are large stone nodes within the biome as well, but they are not mineable within the early game.
        Once you have established a home area it's time to start looking for food. The new Hearth and Home update for Valheim overhauled the food mechanics, and it's now very important to gather a variety of food.
        Within the biome you will find berries and mushrooms. These are great sources of food at first, but once you have early tools animals become huntable. Animals will be a great source of both food and other crafting materials.
        The meadows are home to boars, deer, and necks. Boars are somewhat aggressive and will attack when the player gets too close, but thankfully they aren't too tough of a challenge to take down.
        These will drop boar meat and leather scraps. Deer are more skittish than boars, and they will run if the player scares them. If you can manage to take one down, you will be rewarded with deer meat and hide.
        Necks are the last animal food source that you should be looking out for. They are found near water sources and drop their tails upon death which are a great source of food. The meadows biome is also home to tree-like creatures called greylings as well.
        They are incredibly common, and often they will be the first creature you encounter. They do attack the player, but if you have a weapon equipped, they are not too hard to fight. They will drop regular wood, and resin which will be needed later in the game.

        <h2>Boss 1: Eikthyr</h2>
        <p>Eikthyr is the boss of the meadows biome, and it takes the form of a large deer. In order to summon this boss, you will need three deer trophies. These are dropped by deer upon death, but keep in mind they do not drop every time. 
        Trophies are dropped by every mob in the game, and it's worth picking up everyone you find. Eikthyr's attacks are lightning based, but if you keep your distance the fight is quite easy. I would advise to have at least a bow for this fight as Eikthyr's attacks are mostly close range.
        Once defeated this boss will drop its head and antlers. The player will be asked to return the trophy to the stones where they spawned. Once Eikthyr's head is placed on its stone the player will receive the boss’s power.
        This power provides the player with a stamina boost, and it recharges every fifteen minutes. The antler dropped by this boss is used to create your first pickaxe! This opens the game quite a bit, and with your pickaxe in hand it's time to head to the Black Forest.
